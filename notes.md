Use the following JSON (http://assets.studio71.io/test/news_feed.json) to create a Studio71 News Feed application with Create React App (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and Semantic UI (https://react.semantic-ui.com/introduction).

When ready, upload your app's GIT repo and send us the link. We look forward to seeing all of your creative features, UX, or app structure ideas! Again, if you'd like to supply some notes on the application, you can include them in a NOTES.md file in the repo.
